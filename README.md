## 💸 ILoveSOL Telegram Bot

# New Liquidity Hunter 🤖
# Solana Raydium and Do rugcheck

This Telegram bot is designed to hunt for Solana Raydium tokens and perform rug checks. It opens a websocket to monitor new liquidity pool creations. Once a new pool is detected, the bot pauses the websocket, processes the transaction to extract the mint token, performs a rug check, and then sends you a clear, comprehensive report right in your Telegram chat.

# 🌟 Features

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Monitors new liquidity pool events on the Solana blockchain via a websocket.
- **Token Analysis**: Extracts the mint token from transactions and performs a rug check.
- **Detailed Reports**: Sends concise, easy-to-read notifications directly to your Telegram chat.

# 🛠 Prerequisites

- **Helius API Key**: Sign up and get your API key at Helius.
- **Telegram Bot Token**: Create your bot using BotFather.
- **Telegram Chat ID**: Retrieve your chat ID using this handy bot.
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Git**

*For Android users:* Download Termux from the Google Play Store to set up a terminal environment.

Your bot will start sending you notifications for new liquidity pool creations once it performs its checks.

# ❗ Known Issues

1. **Risky Tokens Not Being Filtered Properly**

   - The `perform_rugcheck` function analyzes tokens but does not prevent notifications for high-risk ones.
   - **Possible fix:** Implement a risk threshold to filter out high-risk tokens.

2. **WebSocket Connection Drops**

   - The WebSocket may fail to reconnect after multiple disconnections.
   - **Possible fix:** Use exponential backoff for reconnection attempts.

3. **Telegram Message Delivery Issues**

   - The bot retries 3 times on failure but does not store failed messages for later retries.
   - **Possible fix:** Implement logging and message queueing for failed attempts.

4. **Transaction Fetching Errors**

   - If the API request to fetch transaction details fails, it only prints an error.
   - **Possible fix:** Add retry logic with increasing delay.

5. **No Handling for API Rate Limits**

   - The script does not detect or handle rate limits from Helius or Telegram APIs.
   - **Possible fix:** Detect rate limit responses and apply exponential backoff.
